    I am thinking about sending $20 (in xDai) to several of my friends, so they may make $5 bets on a "daily question".<br><br>
    Each day, I will post a new question relating to current events, financial news, or sports. Here are some examples of questions:
    <ul>
        <li>Will the current trial cause Derek Chauvin to be convicted of anything?</li>
        <li>Who will win Sunday's nationally televised MLB game between the Dodgers and Yankees?</li>
        <li>Will the Dow 30 close above 34,000 tomorrow?</li>
    </ul>
    You may create a new wager, or accept a wager that someone else proposed.<br><br>
    The person creating a wager will assign odds that the "taker" may accept. For example, you could offer to bet on "No" to the Derek Chauvin question described above,
    and offer the "taker" (who would bet on "Yes") the chance to win only $1 for a $5 bet.
    <br><br>
    Conversely, you could offer to bet on "Yes" to the Derek Chauvin question described above, and offer the "taker" (who would bet on "No") the chance to win $5 for just a $1 bet.
    <br><br>

    To withdraw your profit, you must win at least $30, so your balance must be at least $50. I will then buy your xDai from you, and send to your Paypal account the amount that you want to withdraw, minus the original $20 that I had sent to you.<br><br>
    If you lose the $20, you may buy additional xDai by sending $20 to my Paypal account.
    <hr>
    I would be creating this just for fun, so I need to know how many people will use it.<br><br>
